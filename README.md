👋 Hi, I’m Ricardo Pardono, a Data Science graduate from Universidade Presbiteriana Mackenzie (São Paulo, Brazil) and currently pursuing a postgraduate specialization in Data Analytics at FIAP.

🎓 I also hold a bachelor’s degree in Health Sciences (Dentistry), with two specializations and solid professional experience in the public health sector, which strengthened my analytical thinking, attention to detail, and problem-solving skills.

👀 I’m interested in Data Analytics, Business Intelligence, Python, SQL, Big Data, Data Visualization, Machine Learning, Time Series, AI, and Cloud Computing.

🌱 I’m currently deepening my knowledge in Data Analytics, BI tools, Cloud Services, Big Data ecosystems, and Machine Learning applied to real-world business problems.

💼 I’m seeking opportunities in São Paulo as a Data Analyst / BI Analyst, where I can apply and expand my skills in Python, SQL, Excel, Power BI, ETL processes, data analysis, visualization, and statistical analysis, contributing to data-driven decision-making and business insights.
